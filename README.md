# Machine Learning Project 2019

__Self-Driving Car Exploiting Reinforcement Learning via a Neural Network__

This project was presented on the 23rd of May 2018 in the Department of Computer Science of La Sapienza University in Rome, Italy. It is a Self-Driving Car 3D model built in Unity, with the task of line following. The model takes directions on how to steer the car properly from a Neural Network predicting the right steering angle, with a reinforcement learning approach. For any information about the system, look at the project report [MLP-Prata-Ricciardi.pdf](https://github.com/matteoprata/self-driving-car-rlnn/blob/master/MLP-Prata-Ricciardi.pdf). Feel free to contact us for any additional detail.
